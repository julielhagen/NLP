muppet	Hi , Danny . Sometimes when looking at an article , I see an image with no caption . I feel that when there isnt one , some readers wont know where its from . I was on Sesame Street Game Shows and that image at the beginning was from Mystery Guest . I might feel that a few readers dont know that its from that sketch , and Im wondering if there should be a caption under that image explaning where it is from . But the tricky part for me is that the caption could get reverted by someone . Thats why Im asking you if I , or someone else , should put the caption under the image show that its from Mystery Guest . If the discussion is figured out , you can leave me a message on my talk page . And If I still have trouble with captions , you could help me out

muppet	This category was created by Scott back in 2006 mainly as a temporary measure , when re-organizing the Street Sketches category into subcats , at which time we agreed on certain divisions and distinctions between one-shots and recurring . Since that time , in fact , unless theres something particularly notable or interesting , weve mostly avoided creating one-shot sketch pages if all the info can be easily parked in an episode guide . This category lingered on , though , and reflects a similar problem on Sesame Street Game Shows . I just finished removing the ton of redlinks for random one-shot shows . Ive also recategorized any sketches which were recurring . Plus all game shows , real life or fictional , are listed in a theme category anyway for easy perusal .

muppet	Wasnt sure where else to ask this , but I wanted to just double-check on how were supposed to be listing performers , using the template . Originally , Id gathered we were only to list the voice actor , to avoid debates over , for example , who actually operated Miss Piggy in Muppets from Space . However , Ive noticed thats been changing , especially as weve been adding more Creature Shop characters and the like , where the physical performer and the voice were distinct and clearly credited as such . So , just because Im paranoid and like to be sure before I go back and alter and as Im adding new pages , is that the general format now ? And if it is , what about things like Dinosaurs where all the full-bodied characters typically had * three * performers , one to operate the facial and mouth movements by radio control , one for the body , one for the voice ? Do we use the performer template for human characters , as has been done on the page for John Crichton , or for cartoon animated characters , or do we save it for puppets ? Any discussion or flat-out ruling would be appreciated , and
